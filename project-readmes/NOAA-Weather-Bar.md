Current conditions and forecast information are pulled from NOAAâ€™s National Weather Service for U.S. and from Open Weather Map for international.  Due to limitations on these free weather APIs, the forecast for U.S. locations and Puerto Rico is 7 days but for international is limited to 3 days.  Accuracy of conditions and forecasts are linked to these services.

#### Features
NOAA Weather Bar provides an intuitive search box to look up cities and zip codes, along with a list for recently visited locations and favorites.  It fully supports light and dark mode, and has the option to automatically launch at login.

#### Current Location Permission (Optional!)
NOAA Weather Bar requests location access when first launched, which it uses solely for the purpose of providing the conditions and forecast at your current location.  Granting location permission is entirely optional.

#### PRIVACY
NOAA Weather Bar does not collect any data whatsoever and does not store anything in the cloud.  User preferences (e.g. Current City, Favorites, Recently Visited, Launch at Login, FÂ°/CÂ°, and Animate) are all stored locally.
